# glyphImageMaker
This photoshop script will generate an image file for each glyph at a certain size, color, font and will name the image file according to the glyph name. For instance, the glyph A will be named A.png. The collection of glyph images can then be used in your favourite spritesheet generation tool (e.g. Texture Packer).
